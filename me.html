                <p>
                    Hi, my name is Raúl García, I want to thank you for giving me a little bit of your valued time & taking a look at my project,
                    I really hope you liked it and found something interesting, if that's not the case please let me know how to improve it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Who am I?
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    That's a great question, tricky to answer, I like to describe myself as someone who loves to exercise, an adrenaline freak, 
                    a tech enthusiastic, self taught developer and hacker in process, a melomaniac; Im in love with life & fascinated about the processes behind 
                    everything we use in a daily basis, the internet, I like to break things and decipher how they work, then build them from the ground 
                    improving their mechanism. I like to daydream and work my ass off to accomplish my goals, radical honesty, discipline and persistence are my core
                    values.
                </p>

                <h3> <em>My Journey</em> </h3>

                <p>
                    It's been a long way since I found my passion for technology, but at the start it wasn't like that.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If we take a look at my beginnings I was so confused & lost; after finishing high school I was pursuing a career 
                    in med school, not sure about it, trying to see myself in that industry, don't get me wrong, medicine is a huge field,
                    fascinating and overwhelming as everything worth it in life, but it wasn't my passion, I didn't felt that fire in my inside
                    telling me to learn more and more, to spend whole nights figuring out something, now I feel sure about choosing this path.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm not really sure what's going to happen in the next few years, neither what's going to happen to the world,
                    there might be a way to predict it & I want to find it, but what I'm sure of is that I want to take part in the evolution of technology and human race.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Whenever we face something hard in our life and feel weak or that we are not ready to figure it out
                    it's the moment to look back, analyze our way and be proud of ourselves, everyone has it's own fight,
                    struggling & suffering is a part of life we cannot skip, failure is just a step to succes. 
                    In fire we are forged, from fire we rise to the stars.
                </p>
